/**
 * Real Discord application commands.
 *
 * The daemon also accepts these as plain text, which works but is invisible:
 * Discord's picker and autocomplete only list commands an app has *registered*.
 * Registering them is what makes the surface discoverable.
 *
 * Registration is guild-scoped, not global. Guild commands appear immediately
 * (global ones take up to an hour to propagate) and they only exist where the
 * bot has actually been opted in, which matches how access.json already thinks
 * about channels.
 *
 * Application commands are visible to everyone who can see the channel, so
 * every invocation is authority-checked against the same allowlist as inbound
 * messages, and replies are ephemeral — the answer goes to the person who
 * asked, not the channel.
