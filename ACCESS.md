# Discord — Access & Delivery

Discord only allows DMs between accounts that share a server. Who can DM your bot depends on where it's installed: one private server means only that server's members can reach it; a public community means every member there can open a DM.

The **Public Bot** toggle in the Developer Portal (Bot tab, on by default) controls who can add the bot to new servers. Turn it off and only your own account can install it. This is your first gate, and it's enforced by Discord rather than by this process.

For DMs that do get through, the default policy is **pairing**. An unknown sender gets a 6-character code in reply and their message is dropped. You run `/discord-threads:access pair <code>` from your assistant session to approve them. Once approved, their messages pass through.

All state lives in `~/.claude/channels/discord/access.json`. The `/discord-threads:access` skill commands edit this file; the server re-reads it on every inbound message, so changes take effect without a restart.

## At a glance

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Default policy | `pairing` |
| Sender ID | User snowflake (numeric, e.g. `184695080709324800`) |
| Group key | Channel snowflake — not guild ID |
| Config file | `~/.claude/channels/discord/access.json` |

## DM policies

`dmPolicy` controls how DMs from senders not on the allowlist are handled.

| Policy | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `pairing` (default) | Reply with a pairing code, drop the message. Approve with `/discord-threads:access pair <code>`. |
| `allowlist` | Drop silently. No reply. Use this once everyone who needs access is already on the list, or if pairing replies would attract spam. |
| `disabled` | Drop everything, including allowlisted users and guild channels. |

```
/discord-threads:access policy allowlist
```

## User IDs

Discord identifies users by **snowflakes**: permanent numeric IDs like `184695080709324800`. Usernames are mutable; snowflakes aren't. The allowlist stores snowflakes.

Pairing captures the ID automatically. To add someone manually, enable **User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode** in Discord, then right-click any user and choose **Copy User ID**. Your own ID is available by right-clicking your avatar in the lower-left.

```
/discord-threads:access allow 184695080709324800
/discord-threads:access remove 184695080709324800
```

## Guild channels

Guild channels are off by default. Opt each one in individually, keyed on the **channel** snowflake (not the guild). Threads inherit their parent channel's opt-in; no separate entry needed. Find channel IDs the same way as user IDs: Developer Mode, right-click the channel, Copy Channel ID.

```
/discord-threads:access group add 846209781206941736
```

With the default `requireMention: true`, the bot responds only when @mentioned or replied to. Pass `--no-mention` to process every message in the channel.

**Opting a channel in does not open it to the channel's members.** A channel with no `allowFrom` of its own falls back to the top-level `allowFrom` — your own account. Other people in the room can @mention the bot all they like and their messages are dropped. Use `--allow id1,id2` only to name a *different* set of people than your allowlist, and read "Who you are trusting" below before you do.

```
/discord-threads:access group add 846209781206941736 --no-mention
/discord-threads:access group add 846209781206941736 --allow 184695080709324800,221773638772129792
/discord-threads:access group rm 846209781206941736
```

## Who you are trusting

Anyone the gate admits can send prompts to a Claude Code worker that runs **on your machine, as your user account**, in permission mode `auto`. `auto` approves routine tool calls without asking — only calls a classifier judges risky become Discord buttons. So admitting someone is closer to giving them a shell than to giving them a chatbot: they can read your files, run commands, and reach anything your account can reach.

That is the intended design for a personal assistant you reach from your phone. It is why every default here is closed:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown DM senders | Dropped (pairing code only; approval needs your terminal) |
| Guild channels | Dropped until opted in per channel |
| An opted-in channel with no `allowFrom` | Falls back to your allowlist — not the room |
| Approving a permission prompt | Top-level `allowFrom` only, even in a shared channel |
| `bypassPermissions` | Per thread via `/permissions`, by anyone the gate admits |

The two settings that can widen this are `--allow` on a channel and adding someone with `access allow`. Neither is reversible in effect: a prompt already run has already run. Treat both as "give this person sudo on my laptop", because that is the size of it.

Separately, Anthropic's Agent SDK terms do not permit offering claude.ai logins or rate limits to third parties without prior approval, so a bot that lets other people send prompts through your subscription is not just risky, it is outside the terms. Keep the allowlist to your own account.

## Mention detection

In channels with `requireMention: true`, any of the following triggers the bot:

- A structured `@botname` mention (typed via Discord's autocomplete)
- A reply to one of the bot's recent messages
- A match against any regex in `mentionPatterns`

Example regex setup for a nickname trigger:

```
/discord-threads:access set mentionPatterns '["^hey claude\\b", "\\bassistant\\b"]'
```

## Delivery

Configure outbound behavior with `/discord-threads:access set <key> <value>`.

**`ackReaction`** reacts to inbound messages on receipt as a "seen" acknowledgment. Unicode emoji work directly; custom server emoji require the full `<:name:id>` form. The emoji ID is at the end of the URL when you right-click the emoji and copy its link. Empty string disables.

```
/discord-threads:access set ackReaction 🔨
/discord-threads:access set ackReaction ""
```


**`textChunkLimit`** sets the split threshold. Discord rejects messages over 2000 characters, which is the hard ceiling.

**`chunkMode`** chooses the split strategy: `length` cuts exactly at the limit; `newline` prefers paragraph boundaries.

## Skill reference

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/discord-threads:access` | Print current state: policy, allowlist, pending pairings, enabled channels. |
| `/discord-threads:access pair a4f91c` | Approve pairing code `a4f91c`. Adds the sender to `allowFrom` and sends a confirmation on Discord. |
| `/discord-threads:access deny a4f91c` | Discard a pending code. The sender is not notified. |
| `/discord-threads:access allow 184695080709324800` | Add a user snowflake directly. |
| `/discord-threads:access remove 184695080709324800` | Remove from the allowlist. |
| `/discord-threads:access policy allowlist` | Set `dmPolicy`. Values: `pairing`, `allowlist`, `disabled`. |
| `/discord-threads:access group add 846209781206941736` | Enable a guild channel. Flags: `--no-mention`, `--allow id1,id2`. |
| `/discord-threads:access group rm 846209781206941736` | Disable a guild channel. |
| `/discord-threads:access set ackReaction 🔨` | Set a config key: `ackReaction`, `textChunkLimit`, `chunkMode`, `mentionPatterns`. |

## Config file

`~/.claude/channels/discord/access.json`. Absent file is equivalent to `pairing` policy with empty lists, so the first DM triggers pairing.

```jsonc
{
  // Handling for DMs from senders not in allowFrom.
  "dmPolicy": "pairing",

  // User snowflakes allowed to DM.
  "allowFrom": ["184695080709324800"],

  // Guild channels the bot is active in. Empty object = DM-only.
  "groups": {
    "846209781206941736": {
      // true: respond only to @mentions and replies.
      "requireMention": true,
      // Restrict triggers to these senders. Empty = any member (subject to requireMention).
      "allowFrom": []
    }
  },

  // Case-insensitive regexes that count as a mention.
  "mentionPatterns": ["^hey claude\\b"],

  // Reaction on receipt. Empty string disables.
  "ackReaction": "👀",

  // Threading on chunked replies: first | all | off

  // Split threshold. Discord rejects > 2000.
  "textChunkLimit": 2000,

  // length = cut at limit. newline = prefer paragraph boundaries.
  "chunkMode": "newline"
}
```
